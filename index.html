				🌎 Traveler in the soul, and creative since birth, I've been biting life to the bone! I like to spend my time imagining, and re-imagining interior design. Also, I love animals 🐻, and sports 🏃!

			<h2>Travels</h2>

			<p>
			I had the immense chance to travel the world. Moreover, last January I went on an exchange to Santa Clara University, during which I was able to discover Alaska, Canada, and Hawaii. These were my biggest dreams!

			<h2>Sports</h2>

			<p>
				I have been playing sports since I was very young. Before, I was passionate about modern and classical dance. I also loved rollerblading. Now I like to run more, which allows me to take the pressure off.

			<h2>My project</h2>
	
			<p>
				I have always been a very creative person! Indeed, I always liked what was related to art, photography etc... In fact, I hesitated for a long time between an interior design school and a business school. In the future, I would very much like to link this passion to my job. Why not create my own decoration business? Or my chain of unusual luxury hotels?
